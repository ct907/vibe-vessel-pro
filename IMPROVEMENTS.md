# Vibe Vessel — UX & Functionality Improvement Backlog

Living checklist from the codebase review. Target user: a songwriter **away from
their instrument** who needs to jot down inspiration fast; the app also supports
mocking up arrangements, with a roadmap toward chord-tab export (performance) and
DAW handoff (post-production).

## 1. Capture safety (data-loss prevention) — ✅ done

The product promise is "your idea is safe." These are the highest-priority fixes.

- ✅ **Persist recordings + takes across refresh.** Take/track metadata lived only
  in memory, so a page refresh wiped the recordings strip even though the audio
  blobs survived in IndexedDB. Now persisted to localStorage (reference-guarded so
  playback/level updates don't hammer it) and rehydrated on load.
  (`store/takes.ts`, `store/recordings.ts`, `App.tsx`)
- ✅ **Toast on mic-permission failure.** `RecordFab` no longer silently no-ops;
  it shows an actionable toast. (`components/write/RecordFab.tsx`)
- ✅ **Snapshot before "New Song".** `Landing.startWriting`, `Landing.openRecent`,
  and `VoiceKeyTab.applyKeyToNewSong` now call `commitCurrentSongToRecents()`
  before `resetSong()`/`loadFromJSON`, and clear takes/recordings for a clean
  slate. (`store/song.ts`, `pages/Landing.tsx`, `components/voicekey/VoiceKeyTab.tsx`)
- ✅ **Surface storage-quota failures.** Autosave catches now call a shared
  `notifyStorageQuota()` that warns the user once per session.
  (`store/song.ts`, `store/takes.ts`, `store/recordings.ts`, `lib/storage-quota.ts`)
- ✅ **Reclaim orphaned audio blobs.** `pruneOrphanBlobs` now runs on startup after
  hydration, referencing every blob still held by a take or clip.
  (`App.tsx`, `store/recordings.ts`, `lib/audio/blob-store.ts`)
- ✅ Updated the now-inaccurate "recordings are cleared on page refresh" notice in
  the recordings strip. (`components/write/RecordingsStrip.tsx`)

## 2. Capture speed — ✅ done

Per user decision: keep progressive disclosure (tap cards stay), but make each
card a one-tap action with helper text telegraphing it.

- ✅ "Write Lyrics" card reveals the editor **and focuses the first line** (caret
  ready); "Add Recording" card reveals the strip **and starts recording
  immediately** (via `requestStickyBarRecording()`, dispatched within the tap
  gesture so mic-permission rules apply). Cards show "Tap to start typing" /
  "Tap to start recording" hints. (`components/write/WriteMode.tsx`,
  `components/common/EmptyTapCard.tsx`, `components/write/WriteStickyBar.tsx`)
- ✅ Ungated "Add Section" / "Edit Chords" — always visible in the sticky bar.
  Using them notifies the parent (`onEditorAction`) to reveal the card-gated
  editor so a new section is never invisible. (`components/write/WriteStickyBar.tsx`,
  `components/arrange/ArrangeMode.tsx`)
- ✅ Transcription surfaced: visible ✨ "Detect chords" button on each take card
  (kept in ⋮ menu too) plus a persisted "Auto-detect" toggle in the strip header
  (off by default) that transcribes new takes as they land — covers record and
  import paths. (`components/write/RecordingsStrip.tsx`, `store/transcription.ts`)
- ✅ Lyric typing coalesces into one undo step per burst (3s idle window, broken
  by any other edit or undo/redo) instead of one step per keystroke.
  (`store/song.ts`)

## 3. Unify playback — ✅ done

- ✅ One transport plays synth progression AND recorded tracks together — was
  already wired in `handlePlay` (recordings engine starts at the same AC time as
  the chord scheduler). Confirmed no work needed.
- ✅ Per-section play button added to every section group header in Arrange/
  Progressions. Button is disabled when the section has no chords; lights amber
  while that section is the current playing section. Click sets the start-from
  anchor to the section's first chord and fires `lovable:request-play`.
  (`components/progressions/ProgressionsTab.tsx`)
- ✅ Tempo changes apply to running playback without stopping it.
  `updateScheduledBpm` adjusts `schedOriginAcTime` so the current beat position
  is preserved at the new BPM; `updateEngineBpm` updates the recordings loop
  duration, letting the current loop finish and rescheduing future iterations.
  (`lib/music/audio.ts`, `lib/audio/recordings-engine.ts`,
  `components/header/TransportHeader.tsx`)

## 4. Export roadmap — ⬜ todo

- ⬜ **ChordPro export** (chords-over-lyrics, the performance lingua franca). All
  the data exists in `SectionChord`. (`lib/lyrics/export.ts`)
- ⬜ **MIDI export** (chord track + tempo/time-sig meta, later a melody track).
- ⬜ Per-track WAV stem export via `OfflineAudioContext` for DAW handoff.

## 5. Polish — ⬜ todo

- ⬜ Melody-to-notes transcription using the existing pitch detector
  (`lib/audio/pitch-detector.ts`), not chords-only.
- ⬜ Warn before destructive time-signature re-flow. (`store/song.ts setTimeSignature`)
- ⬜ Wire or remove the per-section arpeggiator toggle. (`components/progressions/ProgressionsTab.tsx`)
- ⬜ Backgrounding/lock protection: finalize + save a recording on `visibilitychange`.
- ⬜ Cross-tab edit protection (single localStorage slot is last-write-wins).
